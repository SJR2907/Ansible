what is shell?
shell is responsible to read commands/applications provided by user.
shell will check whether command is valid or not and whether it is properly used or not. if everything is proper then shell interpretes converts that command into kernel.
understandle form that interpreted command will be handover to kernel 
kernel is responsible to execute that command with the help of hardware. (cpu, ram, processor, hardisk)
shell acts as interface between user and kernel.
shell+kernel is nothing but operating system
